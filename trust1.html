Welcome to The Official Site of
The Mother Teresa Foundation<br>
The Mother Teresa Foundation is a non – government development organisation working for the unwanted, uncared and unloved in the society.<br> It is because the most terrible poverty in the world is loneliness and the feeling of being unloved. <br>Since its inception, following the footprints of its patron Mother Teresa, The Foundation has been concentrating in the fields of education and health of the poor and downtrodden in various ways. <br>The Foundation has been collaborating with other agencies, both governmental and non-governmental towards bringing up the poor children, women and farmers in the mainstream of life.
